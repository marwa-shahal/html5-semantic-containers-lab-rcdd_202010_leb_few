# HTML5 Semantic Elements Lab

## Problem Statement

In HTML5, there are many new tags that help us describe _what kind of content_
exists within a specific tag. These are referred to as _semantic_ elements. In
this lesson, we will be introducing some of the most useful tags.


## Objectives

1. Introduce common semantic tags in HTML
2. Explore their use by applying them to existing content


## Non-Semantic Elements

Before we dive into semantic elements, lets see some examples of _non-semantic_
elements. Two of the most commonly used HTML tags are `span` and `div`. Neither
tag has automatic styling. The only difference between them: content wrapped
with the `span` tag will display without line breaks, whereas content wrapped
with `div` _will_:

```html
<span>This content will share the same line...</span><span>...as this content</span>

<div>
  This message will appear on a new line
</div>
```

These tags certainly have their uses, and developers can sometimes favor them
_because_ of the lack of styling. However, they don't give any indication as to
what type of content they're wrapping. They are just _dividers_ of the content.


## Semantic Elements

Many semantic elements also lack automatic styling, and act very similar to the
`div` tag. What they provide, instead, is an explanation of what they wrap.


#### `<header>` and `<footer>` Tags

The first two semantic tags to discuss are the `header` and `footer` tags. The
purpose of these may seem obvious to those who have used document editors like
Microsoft Word. The `header` tag is used to wrap all content we would want to
contain within the top, (header), portion of a page. The `footer` is for everything
at the foot, (bottom), of a page:

```html
<header>
  <!-- Headers often contain company logos -->
</header>

<!-- All the main content of a web page goes in between -->

<footer>
  <!-- Footers often contain resources, privacy policy links, and copyright information -->
</footer>
```

Commonly, a website with many different pages will have the same header and
footer content on each page...the only content that changes is what is in
between.


#### `<nav>` Tags

Typically, inside or just below the header section of a page are navigation
links to help users access different parts of a website. For this block of
links, we can use the `nav` tag. Wrapping `nav` around links helps describe
those links as the page navigation itself:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="about.html">About</a>
  <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

A reader glancing over an HTML page can quickly see what these links are meant
for. The `nav` tag is not meant for all links, just those typically used for
site navigation.


#### `<main>` Tag

The `main` tag specifies the _main_ content of a web page.  This would typically
be everything in between the `header` and `footer` areas, and may contain many
nested tags:

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>

<main>
  <!-- All the main content of a web page goes here -->
</main>

<footer></footer>
```

With these few tags, common content within a web page can be separated in a way
that is easy to understand.


#### `<section>` Tag

Within the `main` tag, we can continue to breakdown content into specific,
meaningful sections. One way we can do this is to use the...well...`section` tag.

```html
<section>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
</section>
```

The `section` tag can be used to define specific portions of a web page. A page
may have multiple boxes of content within a larger container like `main`. For
each box, we can use a `section` tag to separate the content.


#### `<article>` and `<aside>` Tags

The `section` tag is more informative than the `div` tag, but it still may not
be as specific as we need.  For particular parts of a web page, we have semantic
options like `article` and `aside`. The `article` tag is for containing written
content such as a news story or blog post. The `aside` tag is for containing
content that may be related to other content, but is better kept separated.

```html
<article>
  <h1>First Human Digitizes Brain</h1>
  <p>In 2018, Chrome Boi became the first human to digitize their brain. They now live in the Internet.</p>
</article>

<aside>
  <h4>Once human, now digital</h4>
  <p>A quick visit to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Chrome_Boi will show you the ascended individual</p>
</aside>
```


#### `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` Tags

Along with `section`, `article`, and `aside`, we also have some tags specific for
containing image and media content. The `<figure>` tag wraps self-contained
media content. For instance, a blog post could have an accompanying image to
support the content.

The `figure` tag also comes with a companion for providing captions, the
`figcaption` tag.  Since `figure` is used for media, the `figcaption` tag can be
used to add an additional message about that media or its source.

```html
<section>
  
  <article>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
  </article>
  
  <figure>
    <img src="images/intro-pic.jpg"  alt="An exceptional living room." title="Welcome to Exceptional Living Rooms">
    <figcaption>"An Exceptional Living Room" by Leonardo DaVinci, photograph</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
</section>
```

Here, we've wrapped an image in the `<figure>` tag, and included a `<figcaption>`
providing the title and creator of the image.


## Practice with Semantic Elements

Let's practice what we've discussed. In `index.html`, we have a web page with
some example content for a real estate agency. However, most of the HTML tags
within the `body` are non-semantic `div` and `span` tags.

Your task is to read through the provided comments and add in the appropriate
semantic tags. Run `learn` to test your work and use the provided error
messaging to work through the tests. When finished, run `learn submit`.

**Note:** there are a _few_ semantic tags in `index.html` not explicitly
discussed in this readme. Use the comments to figure out what tag you will have
to use.

Make sure that for every `div` and `span` you replace, that you also replace the
corresponding _closing_ tag!

You can view `index.html` in the browser by running `httpserver` or opening the
file in a separate browser tab.  It is worth noting, though, that the layout of
the page won't change as you add semantic tags. We are not changing the styling
or structure, but the description of the content contained on the page.


## Conclusion

Using semantic tags serves multiple functions. They provide a greater
_readability_ for yourself or anyone else who may edit an HTML document in the
future. They also make it easier to _style_ your pages. As a bonus, they help
search engines identify and categorize content on websites. 

When using Cascading Style Sheets, we can easily set up styling for _just_ the
specific semantic elements. These tags are more natural to write and faster to
understand than `div` and `span` tags.

There are more semantic tags to explore, some of which you've already used! Tags
such as `form` and `table` are semantic as well, as they describe the contents
within.
